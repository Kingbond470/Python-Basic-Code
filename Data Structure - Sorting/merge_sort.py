Merge Sort is a Divide & Conquer principle based algorithm, like  its cousin Quick  Sort. The main idea of merge sort is to divide large data-sets into smaller sets of data, and then solve them. Merge Sort is a recursive algorithm, it divides the given array into smaller halfâ€™s and then calls itself repeatedly to solve them.
